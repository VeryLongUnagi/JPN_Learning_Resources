##Rules
**Please take some time to read the rules so that everyone can enjoy the group without feeling crappy!**



###Instant Bans:
* **Posting or asking for NSFW/Pornographic multimedia content**
* **Criticizing certain groups/race/gender/religion**
* **I have to stress this, but YES the gender part includes people from LGBT communities**
* **Randomely flirting with others and creeping**
* **Any kinds of harrassment**
* **Advertising - consult the admins before doing so**
* **PMing others without their permission**
* **Spamming and Flooding of the chatroom**
* **Joining a group in the aim to be a nuisance**
* **Bullying**

###You'll receive a pre-ban warning with following:**
* **Being violent/aggressive (don't do it if you're gonna say sorry later)**
* **Someone reports you on non-instaban issues and multiple admins deems you've done wrong**
* **You will be banned if you do these after you have been warned once.**

###Things to avoid doing:
* **Polemical Subjects - talking about politics/religion often leads to fights**
* **Being passive agressive - yes, people are aware that you are actually being agressive**
* **Passive agressiveness may lead to a warning and a ban**

###Things that are actually OK:
